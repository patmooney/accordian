Merge and filter redundancy from hierarchical data

```
    // A summary of only the unique elements of the child when compared to a hierarchy of N parents
    const filtered = filterRedundant(child, parent1, parent2);

    // merge all of the hierarchy together (deep merge)
    const rebuilt = rebuild(child, parent1, parent2);
```
